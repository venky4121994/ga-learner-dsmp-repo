### Project Overview

  In this project, we go on to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, I apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Logistic Regression
Auc score
Roc auc plot
