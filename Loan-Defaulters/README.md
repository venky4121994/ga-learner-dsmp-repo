### Project Overview

 For this project I have the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. The data that we have is from 2007-2010


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

1.Train-test split
2.Correlation between the features
3.Decision Tree Modeling
4.Evaluation Metrics
5.Graphviz plotting


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 A decision tree was employed to find the number of people who have paid back the loan and those who have not.
