### Project Overview

 To etimate the r2 socre of various regression model over the melbourne housing price data set.


### Learnings from the project

 1. Train Test Split
2.Lasso Regression
3. RIdge REgression
4. Cross Validation
5. Polynomial Regression


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The main objective of the project was to compare the different r2 score for the aforementioned regression models and see how well the r2 score changes. 


### Challenges faced

 Irrespetive of the usage of Linar, Lasso and RIdge regression the r2 socre did not change substantially. But had quite a bump when a polynomial regression was fit onto the data set.
