### Project Overview

 A Bank Of New York data set was used to analyze whether it can expand its branches and for which certin hyptheses have to be analyzed and tested. Using the inferential statistics we mut try to analyze if the hypotheses on which the banks have framed are solid enough to explain their expansion motives.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a firm understanding of inferential statistics. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Confidence Interval

Central Limit Theorem

Hypothesis Testing

Chi Square Test
